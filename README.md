BOS - Best OS

it's an small my own OS for x86_64 arch

for test this you need:
 - xorriso (create iso file)
 - cargo
 - rustup
 - qemu (virtual machine)

for build it use "build.py"
``` shell
python3 build.py new
```
list of commands:
 - new (build all files, generate ISO file "BOS.iso")
 - clean (deleate all files generated by "new" command)
 - test (start virual machine (qemu) you can use another, but
    you must run iso like CD-rom)
 - inttest (start integration tests (check "./tests" folder))

structure of OS:
 - to 0x7c00 loading bootloader.... (i write this all in future, when OS
    will be ready)
